# eatDaBurgerApp

This is a burger logger app created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. This app lets the user input the names of the burgers they would like to eat. When the user submits the name of the burger, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page. When you click on the burger it will move to the right side of the burger.
